      <h1>Solution Viewer ({{ solutionTitle }})</h1>
      <p>
        Really interesting problem to solve and one that took me some time to
        figure out, especially on part 2.
      </p>
      <p>
        I probably didn't code up the best solution, but it's at least halfway
        decent and runs fairly quickly, so that's good. I definitely got tripped
        up in trying to determine the states that the seats can be in, whether
        that's empty, occupied, floor, or outside of the bounds of the seating
        arrangement.
      </p>

      <p>
        For the first problem, I didn't care too much about that, but for the
        second part, I had to really focus on that and make sure I continued
        searching beyond floor values, which I just represented as empty strings
      </p>
      <p>
        What I also needed to remember was that I
        <i>cared about the value too</i>, not just if it was a floor/"." value
        or not.
